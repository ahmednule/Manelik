      <p>
        Recycling nappies is a simple yet effective way to reduce waste and contribute to a cleaner environment. Our process includes collection, sorting, and recycling of used nappies into reusable materials.

        Is Burning Diapers the Best Solution for Kenya? Certainly Not

In Kenya, millions of disposable diapers end up in residual waste bins every day, destined for incineration. While this is the common method, it is far from ideal. When it comes to disposable diapers, incineration is not sustainable. Although burning generates energy, it also means losing all the materials forever.

Diapers are complex products made from various plastics. Burning these plastics is problematic for two main reasons. Firstly, it destroys a valuable raw material that could be recycled. Secondly, incinerating plastics is detrimental to both the climate and the environment.

      <h2 class="mb-3">Step-by-Step Process</h2>
      <p>
        1. Collection: Nappies are collected from designated bins.<br>
        2. Sorting: Collected nappies are sorted based on material composition.<br>
        3. Recycling: Sorted nappies are processed into reusable materials.

        The nappy recycling process
When it comes to nappy recycling, the magic word is thermal pressure hydrolysis. This is a process that melts down the nappies at a temperature of 250°C and at a pressure of 40 bar rather than incinerate them. As a result, the individual components of the nappies – primarily polymers and cellulose – can be separated from each other and recovered. The whole system generates high quality recycled raw materials – in the form of plastic granules and paper – which can be returned to production cycles and reused. But that’s not all. The leftover material is then enriched with digested sewage sludge in a downstream process. This produces high-purity biogas that can be transformed into green electricity.

      <p>
        Recycling nappies not only helps in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills but also conserves resources and reduces pollution. Here are some key benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces landfill waste</li>
        <li>Conserves natural resources</li>
        <li>Reduces greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Promotes a cleaner and healthier environment</li>
