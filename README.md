Welcome to the Kilimani Hackathon project, developed by **Team Menelik** and funded by the Kilimani Foundation. Our goal is to tackle key urban planning and waste management challenges through an innovative web application built with Django and Bootstrap.

## Problem Statement

Residents often struggle with inefficient waste collection systems, lack of accessible recycling stations, and difficulty in reporting and addressing community issues.
